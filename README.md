# Crime Classification ML models

This project explores the development of machine learning models for classifying crimes based on a large dataset containing over 815,882 crime instances. The goal is to experiment with and evaluate various machine learning models to improve understanding of classification techniques and performance metrics.

## Objective
The primary objective is to analyze and compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms in classifying crimes based on features like time, location, and victim information. This project serves as a learning exercise to:

Gain practical experience in handling large datasets.
Explore and refine machine learning workflows.
Understand the strengths and limitations of models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and boosting.
